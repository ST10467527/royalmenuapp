Royal Menu App – Features and Enhancements

I developed the Royal Menu App to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience for browsing and interacting with a restaurant menu. The key features and improvements are as follows:

Home Screen Personalisation

Displays a welcome message using the user’s name if logged in, or defaults to “Guest.”

Includes a short introduction to guide users on the app’s functionality.

Course Filtering System

Dishes are categorised into Starters, Mains, Desserts, Drinks, and Specials.

Users can filter dishes by tapping the corresponding course pill for quick navigation.

Dynamic Search Functionality

Users can search for dishes by name using the search bar.

Search results update in real-time, improving accessibility and efficiency.

Average Price Calculation per Course

Calculates the average price of all dishes within each course.

Displays average prices in the footer, providing users with insight into pricing trends.

Dish Card Layout

Each dish displays its name, course, and price on a card.

Cards include an arrow icon to indicate further details or customisation options.

FlatList Optimisation

Converts dish IDs to strings in the keyExtractor to prevent runtime errors.

Ensures smooth loading and prevents the app from freezing.

Bottom Navigation Bar

Provides quick access to the Home screen, full Menu, Customise screen, and Login/logout.

Enhances navigation and overall user experience.

Runtime and UX Improvements

Corrected JSX syntax and useMemo dependencies to prevent crashes.
